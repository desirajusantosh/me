# Travel Highlights of Japan
After years of dreaming about it, We finally embarked on our journey to Japan in 2024. Here are some of the unforgettable experiences that made this trip truly remarkable:
* Effortless Travel with the Suica Pass: The Suica pass simplifies intra-city travel, allowing for seamless navigation through urban areas. However, be mindful that it may occasionally present challenges with inter-city travel.
* Embrace the Local Culture: Tourism in Japan is at an all-time high. To fully enjoy your experience, immerse yourself in local customs and behaviors—be like the Japanese!
* Culinary Delights: The food in Japan is not only beautifully presented but also delicious. Every meal is a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.
* Tipping Culture: One unique aspect of dining in Japan is that tipping is not customary. Exceptional service is already included in the experience.
* Rise of Vegan Cuisine: With the growing popularity of veganism, there are increasingly more plant-based options available, catering to diverse dietary preferences.
