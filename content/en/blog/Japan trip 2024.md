Travel highlights of Japan!
Always wanted to go and finally did this trip in 2024. 
1. Suica pass makes your intra-city travel a breeze. Might create hiccups in inter-city travel for noobs like me
2. Tourism is peaking in Japan so when in Japan be like the Japanese
3. Food is picture perfect all the time and tastes amazing often
4. Also, no tips
5. Vegan food is on the rise, due to #2
6. Akihabara is an emotion. A retreat for all ages
7. Shinjuku has regular shopping
8. Ginza is high-end
9. Some places are not worth it without day time light. Ex: Fushimi Inari
10. Trains in Japan reminded me of India. But, they are way faster, better in all ways
11. Trains in Japan can be as close to roller-coasters for some people
12. Coffee culture is great, so it matcha culture
13. Its so clean everywhere
14. Airalo is a must to stay connected without a hassle
