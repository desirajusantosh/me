Have you ever struggled with a virtual machine that just won't fit your screen? I certainly have, and let me tell you, it is frustrating. 
After countless Google searches which leads to stackoverflow and even asking AI for help which sources probably from the same stackoverflow pages, I finally cracked the code. Here's my simple solution for resizing VMs to match your screen resolution:

1. Install Guest Additions: This is the secret sauce. It's like giving your VM a pair of glasses to see your screen clearly.
2. Restart your VM: Sometimes, your virtual machine just needs a quick nap to adjust to its new view.
3. Still not perfect? No worries! If your display hasn't automatically updated, here's the magic trick: 
  Click 'View' in the VirtualBox menu, then select 'Auto-resize Guest Display'. 
  And voil√†! Your VM should now fit your screen like a glove.
