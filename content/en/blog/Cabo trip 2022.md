# Travel highlights of Cabo!
Cabo San Lucas offers the perfect blend of stunning landscapes and vibrant culture, making it a must-visit destination. Here are my travel highlights from this beautiful locale:
* Car Rental is Essential: To fully explore Cabo, renting a car is highly recommended. The hotels and resorts are often spread out, and having your own transportation makes it easy to access various attractions and beaches.
* Resort Vibes: Many resorts in Cabo feel like an extension of the United States, offering familiar amenities and services while still allowing you to enjoy the unique charm of Mexico.
* Vegan Dining Challenges: While there are some vegan options available, finding suitable meals can be difficult outside of hotel restaurants. If you're vegan, consider dining at your resort for the best selection.
* Currency Convenience: Everything is priced in USD, so there’s no significant need to exchange for pesos during your stay. This simplifies budgeting and spending while you enjoy your vacation.
* Street Shopping Insights: Be cautious with street shopping; prices can be surprisingly high. While it’s tempting to browse, you might find better deals in local markets or shops.
* Affordable Medical Shopping: On the flip side, medical supplies and prescriptions can be quite affordable in Cabo, making it a good place to stock up if needed.
* Perfect Weather: With nearly year-round sunshine, Cabo boasts perfect weather that enhances every experience, from lounging on the beach to exploring local attractions.
* Must-See Attractions: Don’t miss iconic spots like El Arco. These landmarks offer breathtaking views and great opportunities for photos.
* Water Activities: Engage in thrilling water activities such as snorkeling or whale watching during the right seasons—Cabo is known for its rich marine life!
* Local Cuisine: While vegan options may be limited, indulge in local Mexican cuisine at various restaurants throughout the area. Fresh seafood and traditional dishes seem to be the highlight.
