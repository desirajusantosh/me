Consistency is key. 💪 

When the activity is not yet a habit, progress straddles on consistency. I've been reading and listening on running quite a bit the past few months. With inspiration still fresh in my head and also to keep myself active during the WFH situation, started running. During the evenings of August, around 7PM, my routine was a run around my block. It was pretty hot this summer in Bay area. Even around 7PM the temps were around 90F. But was happy I could keep this momentum for one full month. 👍
