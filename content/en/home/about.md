This is **Santosh**. I'm creative at heart with heavy tech and design obsession. Currently living and working in the bay area. I work at the intersection of product and advanced hardware/software development. Inspired by the fact that small product decisions make huge impact for users.  

Having a passion for volunteering, I've been involved with organizations which support STEM & mental health. At the moment, I volunteer as a Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line.

Some of my interests in no particular order: travel hacking, poker, working out, active leasure, tea, design, photography, dogs. I'm always happy to have conversations surrounding these or anything in general. Drop me a line.
