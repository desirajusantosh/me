ðŸ‘‹, I'm Santosh! I live in the Bay Area working at the intersection of product and cutting-edge hardware/software development. I'm passionate about how thoughtful product decisions can make a huge impact on people's lives.

Beyond tech, I'm driven to give back. I most recently volunteered as a Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line and am actively involved with organizations supporting STEM education and mental health initiatives.

When I'm not brainstorming the next big thing, you might find me travel hacking my way to a new adventure, mastering a poker strategy, or hitting the gym for an active leisure session. Throw in some tea, design inspiration, photography, and the company of a furry friend, and that's my happy place.

I'm always up for a conversation, whether it's about these interests or anything else under the sun. Feel free to drop me a line!
