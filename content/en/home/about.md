This is **Santosh**. I'm creative at heart. Currently living in the bay area. Professionally, working at the intersection of product and advanced hardware/software development. Inspired by the fact that small decisions make huge impact for customer. Outside of work as well, I'm a strong believer of using data and technology to deliver meaningful impact in people's lives. Having a passion for volunteering, I've been involved with organizations which support STEM & mental health. At the moment, I volunteer as a Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line.

Some of my interests in no particular order: startup ideas, travel hacking, poker, working out, active leasure, tea, blockchain, good design. I'm always happy to have conversations surrounding these or anything in general. Drop me a line.
