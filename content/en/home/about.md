This is **Santosh**. Working at the intersection of product and advanced hardware/software development. Inspired by the fact that small decisions make huge impact for customer. Some of my interests in no particular order: startup ideas, travel hacking, poker, working out, active leasure, tea, blockchain, trading. I'm always happy to have conversations surrounding these or anything in general. Drop me a line. 

Strong believer of using data and technology to deliver meaningful impact in people's lives. Volunteer as a Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line.
